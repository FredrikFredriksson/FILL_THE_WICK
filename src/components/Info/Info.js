          Spawned on the 15th of January 2024 by a developer with fleeting
          commitment, SFTW found its true calling when the community took the
          reins. <br /> <br />
          Reinventing the meme with a vision for utility on the Solana
          blockchain, we're not just playing the gameâ€”we're changing it. Buy,
          hold, and be a part of the journey as we elevate SFTW from its meme
          origins to a cornerstone of utility in the Solana ecosystem.
